## 🎯 **Context Engineering for the Intelligence Age**

### **The Problem with Vibe Coding Today:**

* 🔄 **Endless repetition** — "Here's how we handle auth..." (for the 50th time)
* 🤷 **Context amnesia** — AI forgets your patterns, preferences, and decisions  
* 🏝️ **Project islands** — Learning from one project never benefits another
* 📚 **Knowledge leakage** — Insights evaporate between sessions

## 🛑 **Stop Explaining Yourself to Your AI**

Your IDE agent forgets everything. Cursor doesn't remember your patterns. Claude Desktop starts fresh. Copilot suggests code you already rejected.

**Every session, you start from zero.**

## ✨ **What is MiniMe-MCP?**

A **memory layer** for your IDE agents. One system, works with Cursor, Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, VS Code—any tool that speaks MCP.
